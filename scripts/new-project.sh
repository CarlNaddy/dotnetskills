# ${NEW}

ASP.NET Core Blazor Web App — .NET 10, MudBlazor, EF Core + PostgreSQL.
Started from the [dotnetskills](https://github.com/CarlNaddy/dotnetskills) template.

## Run locally

\`\`\`bash
docker compose up -d db
dotnet tool restore
dotnet run -- seed        # apply migrations + seed sample data
dotnet watch run
dotnet test
\`\`\`

Keeping the \`Listing\` sample for now (worked pattern for auth / jobs /
caching / file storage) — remove it any time with
\`bash scripts/remove-sample.sh\`; then \`dotnet run -- seed\` above becomes
\`dotnet ef database update\` (once you add your first model).

Conventions and AI tooling: see \`CLAUDE.md\`.

Rename done — the \`Listing\` sample feature is still here (it's the worked
pattern every P3/P4 doc points at: auth, jobs, caching, file storage). Remaining
manual steps:

  1. CLAUDE.md — retitle; replace the "Reuse — starting a new project" section
     and parity-plan references with your own notes. Keep Stack, Data access,
     MudBlazor rules, Conventions, Tests, Localization.
  2. compose.yaml — set POSTGRES_DB / POSTGRES_USER / POSTGRES_PASSWORD.
  3. In the folder containing ${NEW}.csproj:
       dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:Default" \\
         "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=<db>;Username=<user>;Password=<pw>"
  4. docker compose up -d db
  5. dotnet format ${NEW}.slnx && dotnet build && dotnet test
  6. (optional) start from an empty skeleton instead of keeping the sample:
       bash scripts/remove-sample.sh
     (regenerates Data/Migrations from scratch — safe any time, doesn't need
     a real database connection yet)
  7. (optional) spec-driven development:  bash scripts/setup-openspec.sh
       then, in Claude Code:  /opsx:propose <feature>  ->  /opsx:apply
  8. Remove the templating helpers you no longer need:
       git rm scripts/new-project.sh scripts/new-project.ps1 \\
         scripts/_guard-not-template.sh docs/new-project.md
     Keep scripts/remove-sample.sh until you've actually run it (or decided to
     keep the sample for good — then remove it too). Keep: scripts/preflight.sh,
     scripts/preflight.ps1, scripts/_find-git-bash.ps1, scripts/check-plugins.sh,
     scripts/install-flyctl.sh, scripts/setup-openspec.sh, docs/ef-migrations.md,
     and — to pull future template updates — scripts/update-from-template.sh,
     docs/updating-from-template.md, .template-version.
  9. git add -A && git commit -m "Initialize from template"

Later, to deploy (Fly.io, P5.3):
     fly auth login && fly apps create <name>   # then set fly.toml's \`app\`
   flyctl is installed by this script — if it was installed just now, open a
   NEW terminal before \`fly\` resolves (see the note at the end of this output).
   Full account-side setup (Postgres, secrets, FLY_API_TOKEN): docs/deployment.md 'P5.3'.

Later, to pull template changes into this project:
     bash scripts/update-from-template.sh --dry-run   # preview
     bash scripts/update-from-template.sh             # apply
   See docs/updating-from-template.md.
