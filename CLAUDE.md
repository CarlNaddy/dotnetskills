ASP.NET Core + **Blazor Web App** with **MudBlazor** for all UI.

> Status: Blazor Web App scaffolded and running on MudBlazor. Being brought to
> Ruby on Rails-level productivity through a phased plan — see
> [`docs/rails-parity-plan.md`](docs/rails-parity-plan.md).

## Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | .NET 10 (adjust `global.json` if pinning; use `dotnet:setup-local-sdk` for a preview SDK) |
| Web | ASP.NET Core, Blazor Web App template |
| Render mode | Interactive Server, global (`@rendermode="InteractiveServer"` on `Routes` + `HeadOutlet` in `App.razor`) |
| UI library | MudBlazor (replaces the template's default Bootstrap) |
| Data access | EF Core 10 + **PostgreSQL** (Npgsql), all environments; wired (parity plan P1) |
| Auth | ASP.NET Core Identity (cookie), EF Core stores in `AppDbContext`; Register/Login/Manage pages, `Listing` policy/role authorization, dev admin seed, external OAuth2 (Google/Microsoft/GitHub) all done (parity plan P3.1–P3.6) |
| Background jobs | Hangfire, storage in the app's own PostgreSQL (own `hangfire` schema, not an EF Core migration); `/hangfire` dashboard gated to the `Admin` role (parity plan P4.1) |
| Email | MailKit via ASP.NET Core Identity's `IEmailSender<TUser>`; Razor-component templates rendered by `HtmlRenderer`; dev sink `smtp4dev` (`compose.yaml`); confirm-before-login + forgot/reset password wired (parity plan P4.2) |
| Tests | xUnit v3 on the Microsoft Testing Platform — `tests/dotnetskills.Tests/` |

## Build / run / test

Solution `dotnetskills.slnx` holds the web app (`dotnetskills.csproj`) and the
test project (`tests/dotnetskills.Tests/`). Package versions are centrally
managed in `Directory.Packages.props`.

```bash
docker compose up -d db     # PostgreSQL for local dev
dotnet tool restore         # dotnet-ef (first run only)
dotnet run -- seed          # apply migrations + seed sample data (idempotent)
dotnet watch run            # dev loop
dotnet test                 # xUnit v3 via the Microsoft Testing Platform
```

## Data access

**EF Core 10 + PostgreSQL** (`Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL`), the same
provider in every environment — no SQLite-in-dev split, so migrations and SQL
never diverge from production. Decided in parity plan P1.1; wiring starts at P1.2.

- **Local dev:** PostgreSQL runs in Docker via `compose.yaml` (the Microsoft
  "ASP.NET Core with Docker Compose" pattern); the file is added in P1.2. Bring
  the DB up with `docker compose up -d db` before `dotnet watch run`.
- **Connection string:** configuration key `ConnectionStrings:Default`. The dev
  value lives in user-secrets (`dotnet user-secrets set ...`), never in
  `appsettings*.json`. Prod supplies it from the environment
  (`ConnectionStrings__Default`).
- **DbContext:** `AppDbContext` under `Data/`, registered with
  `AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(o => o.UseNpgsql(...))` (P1.3).
- **Migrations:** `dotnet ef` via a local tool manifest (`dotnet tool restore`
  first). Workflow, naming, rename/backfill gotchas, rollback, squashing, and
  the CI/deploy story are in [`docs/ef-migrations.md`](docs/ef-migrations.md).
- **Seeding:** `dotnet run -- seed` — applies pending migrations, then inserts
  sample data if the DB is empty and the `Admin` role + a dev admin user if
  missing (all idempotent). Fresh clone → one command. Sample data lives in
  `Data/Seed/DbSeeder.cs`; the admin user in `Data/Seed/IdentitySeeder.cs` (see
  the auth section for credentials).
- Entities are the model — query `DbContext` directly, no repository layer.

## Authentication & authorization

**ASP.NET Core Identity** with EF Core stores — the self-contained
username/password model (the Devise analog), cookie authentication, roles
enabled. Decided in parity plan **P3.1**; Identity + stores + the `AddIdentity`
migration wired in **P3.2**; Register/Login/Logout/Manage pages in **P3.3**;
policy/role authorization on the `Listing` feature in **P3.5**; dev admin seed
in **P3.6**; external OAuth2 (Google / Microsoft / GitHub) in **P3.4**.
Full render-mode × auth matrix and pitfalls: `dotnet-blazor:configure-auth`.

- **User entity:** `ApplicationUser : IdentityUser` under `Data/` (one type per
  file, like every other entity). Add profile columns to it directly — no
  separate profile table until one is actually warranted.
- **DbContext:** the Identity tables live in **`AppDbContext`**, which is
  `AppDbContext : IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser>` — one database, one
  context, one migration history (monolith-first, guiding principle 1). No
  separate `ApplicationDbContext`. `OnModelCreating` must call
  `base.OnModelCreating(builder)` first (and the parameter is named `builder` to
  match the base — CA1725).
- **Context lifetime:** components use `IDbContextFactory<AppDbContext>` (P1.8),
  but the Identity EF stores need a *scoped* `AppDbContext` —
  `Program.cs` adds `AddScoped<AppDbContext>(sp => sp
  .GetRequiredService<IDbContextFactory<AppDbContext>>().CreateDbContext())` so
  both share one configuration.
- **Roles & policies:** `AddRoles<IdentityRole>()` + `AddDefaultTokenProviders()`.
  Named policies are registered in `Program.cs` via `AddAuthorizationBuilder()`.
  The `Listing` feature is the worked pattern (P3.5): **public to read, gated to
  write** — `ListingsWriter` (`RequireAuthenticatedUser`) on the create/edit
  pages, `ListingsAdmin` (`RequireRole("Admin")`) on delete. `[Authorize(Policy
  = "…")]` protects the *page*; `<AuthorizeView Policy="…">` hides the *button*;
  a delete handler also re-checks the role in code
  (`Components/AuthStateExtensions.cs` → `AuthState.IsInRoleAsync("Admin")`) —
  the button being hidden is not a security boundary.
- **Admin seed (P3.6):** `dotnet run -- seed` also runs
  `Data/Seed/IdentitySeeder.cs` — creates the `Admin` role and a dev admin user
  if missing (idempotent). Credentials from config keys `Seed:AdminEmail` /
  `Seed:AdminPassword`; the dev default is `admin@dotnetskills.local` /
  `Admin!23456`. Outside Development a `Seed:AdminPassword` **must** be supplied
  — the seeder throws rather than use the built-in default.
- **Identity UI:** hand-authored Razor pages under `Components/Account/`
  (`Pages/Register.razor`, `Pages/Login.razor`, `Pages/Manage/Index.razor`,
  plus `ConfirmEmail.razor` / `ForgotPassword.razor` / `ResetPassword.razor`
  from P4.2 — see "Email" below). The stock Identity UI Razor Class Library
  ships Bootstrap markup and is excluded by the "all UI is MudBlazor" rule.
  `Register.razor` no longer signs the user in immediately — confirm-before-login
  is on (P4.2).
- **The one MudBlazor exception — form inputs:** Identity pages use **native**
  `InputText` / `InputCheckbox` / `ValidationMessage` for bound fields, styled
  with the `.account-input` / `.account-validation` classes in `wwwroot/app.css`
  — not `MudTextField` / `MudCheckBox`. MudBlazor's inputs bind through
  interactive JS/event wiring and render **no `name` attribute**, so they can't
  take part in the native `<form>` POST a static-SSR `EditForm` needs (found
  the hard way in P3.3: a `MudTextField`-built register form posted with the
  email/password fields silently missing). `MudButton` / `MudAlert` / `MudText`
  / `MudLink` / `MudGrid` are unaffected — they don't carry bound form values —
  and stay MudBlazor everywhere, including these pages.
- **Sign-out is a minimal API endpoint, not a component:**
  `Endpoints/AccountEndpoints.cs` maps `POST /Account/Logout`. A plain
  `<form action="Account/Logout" method="post">` (with `<AntiforgeryToken />`)
  posts to it from anywhere — the interactive app-bar `AccountMenu` included —
  because it's a real HTTP request handled by routing, independent of the
  calling page's render mode.
- **Render mode (the trap):** `SignInManager` / `UserManager` touch `HttpContext`
  and throw in interactive components. Every Identity *page* (Register, Login,
  Manage) renders as **static SSR** — `@attribute [ExcludeFromInteractiveRouting]`
  — and `App.razor` returns a `null` render mode when
  `HttpContext.AcceptsInteractiveRouting()` is false. Interactive components
  (`AccountMenu`, `Routes.razor`'s `AuthorizeRouteView`) read auth state from
  `CascadingAuthenticationState` / `Task<AuthenticationState>` / `AuthorizeView`,
  never from `HttpContext.User`; `Program.cs` adds
  `AddCascadingAuthenticationState()`. Anonymous hits on an `[Authorize]` page
  render `Components/Account/Shared/RedirectToLogin.razor` via
  `AuthorizeRouteView`'s `<NotAuthorized>` template.
- **Redirect after a static-SSR form post:** `NavigationManager.NavigateTo`
  during static rendering throws a `NavigationException` the framework turns
  into an HTTP redirect — wrapped as `Components/Account/IdentityRedirectManager`
  so Register/Login don't repeat the open-redirect guard.
- **External login (P3.4):** Google and Microsoft via the first-party
  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google` / `.MicrosoftAccount` handlers;
  GitHub via `AspNet.Security.OAuth.GitHub` (Microsoft ships no handler). Each
  provider registers in `Program.cs` **only when configured** — keys
  `Authentication:Google:{ClientId,ClientSecret}` (same shape for `Microsoft`
  and `GitHub`), from user-secrets in dev / env vars in prod, never
  `appsettings*.json`. Callback paths are the handler defaults —
  `/signin-google`, `/signin-microsoft`, `/signin-github` — register these as
  the redirect URIs with each provider. Step-by-step provider registration, the
  exact `dotnet user-secrets` commands, dev/prod redirect URIs, and
  troubleshooting (incl. "no buttons on the Login page" = nothing configured):
  [`docs/external-login.md`](docs/external-login.md).
  - Flow: `Login.razor` renders one `<form>` per configured provider →
    `POST /Account/PerformExternalLogin` (`Endpoints/AccountEndpoints.cs`)
    issues the `Challenge` → provider → `/signin-<provider>` middleware →
    `Components/Account/Pages/ExternalLogin.razor`.
  - `ExternalLogin.razor` signs in if the login is already linked; otherwise it
    **auto-provisions** a local `ApplicationUser` from the provider's verified
    email claim and links it (`EmailConfirmed = true`). This trusts the
    provider's email verification (Google/Microsoft always; GitHub via the
    `user:email` scope). No email-confirmation step — the Rails "sign in with
    Google just works" behaviour.
- **Seeding:** a known dev admin user + the `Admin` role are seeded by
  `Data/Seed/IdentitySeeder.cs` (P3.6), idempotent like the rest of the seed.

## Background jobs

**Hangfire** — no first-party ASP.NET Core job framework exists, so this is
net-new (parity plan **P4.1**). Storage is the app's own PostgreSQL, no
separate infra; `Hangfire.PostgreSql` creates and manages its own `hangfire`
schema itself on every startup — **not** an EF Core migration, `Data/Migrations/`
never touches it. Decisions, the worked pattern, and how to add a new job:
[`docs/background-jobs.md`](docs/background-jobs.md).

- `Program.cs`: `AddHangfire(...).UsePostgreSqlStorage(...)` + `AddHangfireServer()`
  (a hosted service — starts on `app.Run()`, never during `dotnet run -- seed`).
  `MapHangfireDashboard("/hangfire", ...)` gated to the `Admin` role via
  `Features/Jobs/HangfireDashboardAuthorizationFilter.cs` — the dashboard shows
  job payloads and lets you trigger/delete jobs, so it's not public.
- **The worked pattern:** `Features/Jobs/ListingJobs.cs` — a plain class,
  constructor-injected per invocation (`IDbContextFactory<AppDbContext>`, not a
  scoped `AppDbContext`), enqueued/scheduled **by method reference**, not a
  lambda closing over local state. One fire-and-forget job
  (`RecordListingCreatedAsync`, enqueued from `ListingCreate.razor` after a
  successful save) and one recurring job (`RecordDailyListingCountAsync`,
  registered via `IRecurringJobManager.AddOrUpdate` at startup, daily).
- `Data/JobRun.cs` is the app-level "a job did X" audit row — Hangfire's own
  storage tracks execution state but prunes succeeded-job history, so it isn't
  a substitute for an actual audit trail.
- **Testing:** job bodies are ordinary `AppDbContext` consumers — test them the
  P2.3 way, against real Postgres via `DatabaseTest`
  (`tests/dotnetskills.Tests/Features/Jobs/ListingJobsTests.cs` is the worked
  example). Don't test Hangfire's own scheduling/dispatch.

## Email

**MailKit**, behind ASP.NET Core Identity's own `IEmailSender<TUser>` seam —
no first-party mail-sending library exists, so this is net-new (parity plan
**P4.2**), but the *hook point* Identity's scaffolded pages use is first-party.
Templates are Razor **components** (this app is Blazor, not MVC — no
`IRazorViewEngine` to reuse), rendered to HTML strings by
`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.HtmlRenderer` (first-party, .NET 8+, the
official way to render a component outside a request). Dev sink: **smtp4dev**
(`compose.yaml` service `mail`, web UI at `http://localhost:5001`) — zero
config needed, `EmailOptions`' defaults already point at it. Decisions, the
worked pattern, and how to add a new email:
[`docs/email.md`](docs/email.md).

- `Program.cs`: `AddIdentityCore<ApplicationUser>(o => o.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount
  = true)` — a registered user must confirm their email before signing in;
  `SignInManager` returns `SignInResult.NotAllowed` automatically, which
  `Login.razor` gives its own message. External logins and the dev admin seed
  are unaffected — both already set `EmailConfirmed = true` (P3.4/P3.6).
- **Confirmation flow:** `Register.razor` no longer signs in immediately —
  it generates a confirmation token, sends it via
  `EmailSender.SendConfirmationLinkAsync`, and shows a "check your email"
  message. `Components/Account/Pages/ConfirmEmail.razor` completes it when
  the link is clicked.
- **Password reset flow:** `ForgotPassword.razor` → `SendPasswordResetLinkAsync`
  → `ResetPassword.razor` → `ResetPasswordConfirmation.razor`. Same
  anti-enumeration behavior as stock Identity — the same message shows
  whether or not the email was found.
- `Features/Email/MailKitEmailSender.cs` implements all three
  `IEmailSender<TUser>` methods (confirmation link, reset link, reset code);
  this app's own UI only exercises the first two — the code-entry variant is
  implemented for interface completeness (an API/mobile client would use it),
  not driven by a page here.
- **Testing:** `RazorEmailRenderer` is pure and deterministic (no SMTP, no
  database) — tested directly
  (`tests/dotnetskills.Tests/Features/Email/RazorEmailRendererTests.cs`).
  Don't test MailKit's own SMTP behavior; the full send path was verified
  manually end-to-end (see `docs/email.md`), not as an automated test.

## Claude Code plugins & skills

AI tooling for this repo is pinned in `.claude/settings.json` (committed). It
declares one marketplace and enables plugins from it:

| Marketplace | Source | Enabled plugins |
|---|---|---|
| `dotnet-agent-skills` | GitHub `CarlNaddy/claude-plugins-dotnet` | `dotnet`, `dotnet-aspnetcore`, `dotnet-blazor`, `dotnet-data`, `dotnet-test`, `dotnet11`, `mudblazor` |

`CarlNaddy/claude-plugins-dotnet` is a **vendored freeze** of Microsoft's
[`dotnet/skills`](https://github.com/dotnet/skills) (all its plugins, copied
verbatim at a known commit — see that repo's `vendor/dotnet-skills/UPSTREAM.md`)
plus the app-maintained `mudblazor` plugin. Freezing gives deterministic skill
behavior across machines and over time; the marketplace only moves when its
`scripts/vendor-dotnet-skills.sh` is re-run and pushed. It also carries, but does
**not** enable here, the rest of the upstream set — `dotnet-advanced`,
`dotnet-ai`, `dotnet-diag`, `dotnet-maui`, `dotnet-msbuild`, `dotnet-nuget`,
`dotnet-template-engine`, `dotnet-test-migration`, `dotnet-upgrade`,
`dotnet-experimental`; add any to `enabledPlugins` per project if a task needs it.

**Onboarding:** open the repo in Claude Code and accept the prompt to trust the
`dotnet-agent-skills` marketplace. The plugins listed under `enabledPlugins`
install automatically. No plugin content is committed here — it is cached under
`~/.claude/plugins/` and re-fetched from the marketplace repo. Run
`bash scripts/check-plugins.sh` to confirm every expected marketplace and plugin
is installed and enabled (`--fix` registers the marketplace and installs any that
are missing, for headless / CI setups). `scripts/preflight.sh` also reports this.
Keep `.claude/settings.json` to project config only; personal prefs (`theme`,
etc.) belong in your user `~/.claude/settings.json`.

The `dotnet` plugin provides the C# LSP. It needs the **.NET 10 SDK** on PATH
(`dnx roslyn-language-server`); with only .NET 8 installed it won't start — add
one via `dotnet:setup-local-sdk`.

### Which skill for which task

| Task | Skill |
|---|---|
| Install/pin a specific or preview .NET SDK | `dotnet:setup-local-sdk` |
| Create the Blazor project, choose render mode | `dotnet-blazor:create-blazor-project` |
| Plan a multi-section page / component breakdown | `dotnet-blazor:plan-ui-change` |
| Write or review a `.razor` component | `dotnet-blazor:author-component` |
| Forms, validation, user input | `dotnet-blazor:collect-user-input` |
| Share state across components / render modes | `dotnet-blazor:coordinate-components` |
| Call APIs, loading/error states | `dotnet-blazor:fetch-and-send-data` |
| JS interop (incl. MudBlazor's JS timing issues) | `dotnet-blazor:use-js-interop` |
| Prerendering bugs (flicker, double load, null) | `dotnet-blazor:support-prerendering` |
| Auth / `[Authorize]` / AuthenticationStateProvider | `dotnet-blazor:configure-auth` |
| REST API endpoints, OpenAPI, error middleware | `dotnet-aspnetcore:dotnet-webapi` |
| File upload endpoints (minimal API) | `dotnet-aspnetcore:minimal-api-file-upload` |
| OpenTelemetry tracing / metrics / logs | `dotnet-aspnetcore:configuring-opentelemetry-dotnet` |
| Scaffold CRUD pages/endpoints over EF Core | `dotnet-data:create-datadriven-aspnetcore` |
| Slow EF Core query / too many round-trips | `dotnet-data:optimizing-ef-core-queries` |
| `System.Text.Json` on .NET 11 | `dotnet11:system-text-json-net11` |
| Create the first test project / wire CI discovery | `dotnet-test:scaffold-dotnet-test-project` |
| Write unit tests for existing code | `dotnet-test:code-testing-agent` |
| Run tests / get the right `dotnet test` command | `dotnet-test:run-tests` |
| Audit test quality / coverage / gaps | `dotnet-test:test-anti-patterns`, `dotnet-test:coverage-analysis`, `dotnet-test:test-gap-analysis` |
| Any MudBlazor work — setup, components, theming, app-owned components | `mudblazor:mudblazor` |

No upstream skill covers MudBlazor, so we maintain our own: the **`mudblazor`
plugin**, hosted in the `dotnet-agent-skills` marketplace repo
(`github.com/CarlNaddy/claude-plugins-dotnet`) alongside the vendored
`dotnet/skills` copy. It provides the `mudblazor:mudblazor` skill — `SKILL.md`
plus `references/patterns.md` (consumer code patterns) and
`references/authoring-components.md` (conventions for components this app builds
on MudBlazor). Read it before any MudBlazor work. The `dotnet-blazor:*` skills
still apply to the component architecture around MudBlazor. To change the
guidance, edit the plugin repo and bump its `version`, not this file.

## MudBlazor rules (always apply)

- **All UI is MudBlazor.** No Bootstrap, Tailwind, or hand-rolled grid/utility
  CSS. Component-local tweaks go in a collocated `.razor.css`. **One exception:**
  bound form inputs on Identity's static-SSR pages use native `InputText` /
  `InputCheckbox`, not `MudTextField` / `MudCheckBox` — see "Authentication &
  authorization" above.
- **Pin the version exactly** in the `.csproj`. The API differs a lot across
  v6/v7/v8 and model knowledge is often stale — check the installed version and
  confirm signatures against `https://mudblazor.com/api/<component>` before
  writing component code.
- MudBlazor needs an **interactive render mode**; `MainLayout` must host
  `<MudThemeProvider>`, `<MudPopoverProvider>`, `<MudDialogProvider>`,
  `<MudSnackbarProvider>`, and `MudBlazor.min.js` must load **after**
  `blazor.web.js`.
- Model-bound forms: `EditForm` + `DataAnnotationsValidator` + Mud inputs.
  Use `MudForm` only for dynamic/standalone validation.
- Modals via `IDialogService.ShowAsync<T>()`; toasts via `ISnackbar.Add()`.
  Don't build custom overlay/notification infrastructure.
- Tables: prefer `MudDataGrid<T>`; push paging/sorting/filtering into the query
  for server-side data.

First-time setup and every code pattern (wiring, `MainLayout`, forms, dialogs,
data grid, theme, dark mode, pitfalls), plus the rules for authoring our own
MudBlazor-based components, are in the `mudblazor:mudblazor` skill.
Scaffolding alternative: `dotnet new install MudBlazor.Templates`.

## Conventions

### Project layout (decided in P0.2)

**Single project.** `dotnetskills.csproj` is the whole app; organize by concern
in folders, not by extracting class-library projects.

```
dotnetskills.csproj
  Components/    Blazor UI (Layout/, Pages/, shared components)
  Data/          AppDbContext, entities, EF Core migrations, seeders
  Features/      application logic — one folder per feature (services, handlers)
  Endpoints/     minimal API endpoint groups
  wwwroot/       static assets
```

Rationale: the parity goal is Rails-like throughput, and Rails is one deployable
with convention-based folders. A single project keeps the inner loop fast (no
cross-project references, one build, one `dotnet watch`) and matches how the
`dotnet-data` / `dotnet-blazor` skills expect to scaffold. Compile-time layer
enforcement (a `.Domain` with no dependencies, etc.) is not worth the ceremony
at this size. Extract a project later only when a real reuse or deployment
boundary appears — the folders above map cleanly onto `.Web` / `.Application` /
`.Domain` / `.Infrastructure` if that day comes.

Tests live in a separate project under `tests/` (added in P2.1), not in the web
project.

### Build settings & analyzers

- **`Directory.Build.props`** (repo-wide): `Nullable` + `ImplicitUsings` enable,
  `LangVersion` latest, `AnalysisMode` Recommended, `TreatWarningsAsErrors`
  true. Compiler and .NET analyzer (CAxxxx) warnings fail the build. `.csproj`
  files keep only project-specific settings (`TargetFramework`, package refs).
- **`.editorconfig`**: CRLF, 4-space C# / 2-space markup, file-scoped
  namespaces, `_camelCase` private fields, full naming rules. Code-style
  (IDExxxx) rules run in the IDE and `dotnet format`, not the build —
  `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild` stays `false`; flip it to `true` once
  `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` runs clean (not a blocker).
- Format check: `dotnet format dotnetskills.slnx --verify-no-changes`.
- **Central package management** (`Directory.Packages.props`,
  `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally=true` + transitive pinning): every version
  lives there; `.csproj` `PackageReference`s carry no `Version`.

### Naming & style

- File-scoped namespaces; namespace mirrors the folder
  (`dotnetskills.Features.Listings`).
- One public type per file; file name matches the type.
- `_camelCase` private fields; `PascalCase` types / members / constants;
  `camelCase` locals & parameters; `I`-prefixed interfaces. Async methods end
  with `Async` (except Blazor lifecycle overrides and UI event handlers).
- Nullable reference types are on — model nullability honestly; no
  `#nullable disable`, no reflexive `!`.

### Folder conventions

- `Components/Pages/` — routable components (`@page`). `Components/Layout/` —
  layout, `NavMenu`. `Components/Shared/` — reusable non-routable components
  (create when the first one appears).
- `Data/` — `AppDbContext`, entities (one per file), `Data/Migrations/`
  (EF-generated), `Data/Seed/`.
- `Features/<Feature>/` — feature services, view models, validators; may hold
  components specific to that feature.
- `Endpoints/` — minimal-API `Map*` extension methods grouped by resource,
  called from `Program.cs`. No `Controllers/` unless a real MVC need appears.
- Repo root holds `Program.cs` only.

### Services, DI, data access

- Register services in `Program.cs`, or a small `Add<Feature>()` extension per
  feature folder. Anything that touches `DbContext` is `Scoped`.
- EF Core entities are the model — query `DbContext` with LINQ from feature
  services or components; no repository layer (Guiding principle 4 in the parity
  plan). Migration workflow: [`docs/ef-migrations.md`](docs/ef-migrations.md).

### Blazor

- Global Interactive Server render mode (see the Stack table). Move `@code` into
  a code-behind `.razor.cs` once it passes ~30 lines; component-local styles go
  in a collocated `.razor.css`. All UI is MudBlazor — see the rules above.

### Localization

- `AddLocalization(o => o.ResourcesPath = "Resources")` +
  `UseRequestLocalization`. Supported cultures: `en` (default), `de`.
- Strings: inject `IStringLocalizer<SharedResource>` (marker type in
  `Localization/`), look up by key. Translations live in
  `Resources/Localization/SharedResource.<culture>.resx`; the neutral `.resx` is
  the fallback / English.
- Culture is a cookie (`.AspNetCore.Culture`). `CultureSelector` (app bar) hits
  `GET /culture/set?culture=&redirectUri=` (`Endpoints/CultureEndpoints.cs`),
  which writes the cookie and does a `LocalRedirect` — the full reload is what
  makes a new Blazor Server circuit adopt the culture.
- Only the nav + `Home` are localized so far (P0.7 is the foundation); localize
  more strings as pages are touched.

### Tests

- One test project: `tests/dotnetskills.Tests/` (xUnit v3, `namespace
  dotnetskills.Tests.*` mirroring the folder). Run with `dotnet test`.
- **MTP mode:** `global.json` opts `dotnet test` into the Microsoft Testing
  Platform (`"test": { "runner": "Microsoft.Testing.Platform" }`); the test
  project is `OutputType=Exe`. No `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`.
- The web project is a Web SDK project at the repo root, so its `.csproj`
  excludes `tests/**` from the default globs — keep that exclusion if the layout
  changes.
- Test method names: `Method_under_test_does_x` (underscores; CA1707 is off).
  Assertions must be deterministic — no clock, network, process, or real
  filesystem.
- **Test data:** fluent builders under `tests/dotnetskills.Tests/TestData/`, one
  per entity (`ListingBuilder` is the worked example — P2.2). Valid-by-default,
  `With*` methods to pin the fields a test cares about, `Build()` / `BuildMany(n)`
  / static `Valid()`. Defaults come from `Bogus` with a **fixed seed** so
  unconfigured data is identical every run; pass a seed to the constructor for a
  distinct-but-repeatable set. Conventions: [`docs/test-data.md`](docs/test-data.md).
- **Database tests (P2.3):** the tier that hits `AppDbContext` runs against **real
  PostgreSQL in a throwaway `Testcontainers` container** — never SQLite / EF
  in-memory (parity plan P1.1: one provider everywhere). Infrastructure in
  `tests/dotnetskills.Tests/Infrastructure/` — `PostgresFixture` (one container
  per run, migrations applied once, shared via `[Collection("database")]`),
  `DatabaseTest` base class (`CreateContext()`, per-test table wipe via
  `ResetAsync`, `Ct` token). `ListingPersistenceTests` is the worked example.
  **These tests need Docker running.** Details:
  [`docs/testing-database.md`](docs/testing-database.md).
- **Component tests (P2.4):** `bunit` 2.x (framework-agnostic, works with xUnit
  v3). Derive from `Infrastructure/MudBlazorTestContext` — it registers
  `AddMudServices()` and sets `JSInterop.Mode = Loose` so menus / dialogs /
  popovers render without a browser; a component that opens one still needs its
  provider (`MudDialogProvider`, `MudPopoverProvider`) rendered in the test tree.
  Re-query after every interaction, prefer `ClickAsync` / `ChangeAsync`, assert
  semantically. `Components/DeleteListingDialogTests` is the worked example
  (render + click → `DialogResult`).
- **Coverage (P2.5):** MTP-native via `Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage`
  — `dotnet test -c Release -- --coverage --coverage-output-format cobertura`.
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs restore → build → test-with-coverage on push to
  `main` + PRs, writes a summary, uploads the Cobertura file. Baseline and how to
  read it: [`docs/testing-coverage.md`](docs/testing-coverage.md).

## Reuse — starting a new project

This repo doubles as a starting point for new .NET monoliths. Route: GitHub
**"Use this template"**, then `bash scripts/new-project.sh <NewName>` for the
mechanical rename (identifier, `.csproj`/`.slnx`/`tests/` paths, `UserSecretsId`),
then the manual follow-up. Full walkthrough, verified end-to-end:
[`docs/new-project.md`](docs/new-project.md). A real `dotnet new` template — the
`rails new` equivalent — is parity plan **P7.2**.

`docs/rails-parity-plan.md` and `docs/setup-log.md` are this repo's history and
the script deletes them. `docs/ef-migrations.md` is kept (its conventions apply
to any project). `scripts/new-project.sh` and `docs/new-project.md` are removed
by hand once the new project is set up.

`scripts/new-project.sh` and `scripts/remove-sample.sh` (the latter runnable
standalone too) both refuse to run — via a shared `scripts/_guard-not-template.sh`
— if this repo's `origin` remote is still the canonical
`github.com/CarlNaddy/dotnetskills`: a project created the documented way (GitHub's
"Use this template", then clone *that* new repo) never has this origin, only the
template repo itself does, so the check only ever fires by mistake. Bypass with
`I_UNDERSTAND_THIS_IS_THE_TEMPLATE=1`, for genuine template-maintenance work only.

`new-project.sh` records the template commit it branched from in
`.template-version`; a spun-off project pulls later template changes with
`bash scripts/update-from-template.sh` (diffs the template forward from that
baseline, rewrites the `dotnetskills` identifier in the diff, 3-way applies;
never touches `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `compose.yaml`). See
[`docs/updating-from-template.md`](docs/updating-from-template.md).
